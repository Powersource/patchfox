  <p>For some reason your Patchfox installation is not able to communicate with the running scuttlebot. This can happen for
    various reasons which are outlined below. Please check each of them.</p>
  <h2>1. No scuttlebot running</h2>
  <p>Patchfox uses a local running scuttlebot to connect to the Secure Scuttlebutt network. You can provide it through any of
    the following options:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>By allowing Patchfox to start a local native app. For this to work you need to have followed the setup outlined
      <a href="https://github.com/soapdog/patchfox/blob/master/host_app/readme.md">in Patchfox Host App ReadMe file</a>.</li>
    <li>By launching another SSB client that has a bundled scuttlebot such as Patchwork or Patchbay.</li>
    <li>By starting your own scuttlebot from the command-line as shown in
      <a href="http://www.scuttlebot.io/">this page about scuttlebot</a>.</li>
  </ol>
  <h2>Patchfox can't find the configuration for your sbot</h2>
  <p>If you're using another SSB client or running your own scuttlebot, then Patchfox can't find the configuration on its own.
    You will need to go to the
    <a id="launch-settings" href="#">Patchfox Settings page</a> in the
    <a href="about:addons">About Add-ons page</a> and set it up.</p>
  <p>Your
    <i>secret</i> is located in a folder called
    <i>.ssb</i> in your own users home folder in a file named
    <i>secret</i>, keep this file safe. Patchfox will try to guess your remote when you paste your secret into the textarea.</p>
