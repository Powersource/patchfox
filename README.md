# PATCHFOX - A Secure Scuttlebutt client for Firefox as a WebExtension

This is an **ALPHA** quality WebExtension.

* Check out the [ReadMe for the WebExtension](webextension/readme.md), it contains important information on how to setup your credentials.
* Check out the [ReadMe for the Native Companion App](host_app/readme.md), it contains important information on how to setup the helper app.


# Contributing

This is free software under the terms of the MIT license. I would love contributions to this WebExtension. I tried to make it as vanilla as possible to the point that it is quite naive. My objective is to make it approachable for new contributors with minimal knowledge of JS and Elm.

The WebExtension is running on a different and isolated DOM than the page being displayed so we don't need to worry about many stuff that is common to Web Development.

If you want to contribute, these are some ideas:

* Need to expose more API calls.
* Need a shim to make WebExtension developer life easier so they don't keep programming in such low-level API like `ports`.
* Need robust setup code and instructions.
